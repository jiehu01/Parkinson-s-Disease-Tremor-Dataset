# Parkinson-s-Disease-Tremor-Dataset
We compiled multiple Parkinson's disease (PD) tremor datasets, each collected using IMU sensors. The tremor severity in these datasets is labeled on a scale from 0 to 3. Further details can be found in the paper Time Series Adaptation Network for Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition.
